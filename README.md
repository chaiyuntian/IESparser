IES file parser for LM-63-2002 format files

Have tested on many different .ies files from many different manufacturers to verify.

This class allows for an input string of an .ies filepath and outputs a matrix dictionary to be passed on to either an interpolator (another project I am working on to open source) or another bit of code to work with your Dictionary matrix.
